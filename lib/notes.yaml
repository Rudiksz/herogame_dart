App State:
  User: the logged in account
  Dive Centers: - all divecenters the user can edit or view
  Staff: - all the staff of the above dive centers
  Activity Panels: - all activity panels of the above dive centers
  Dashboard sections: all the dashboard sections of the above dive centers and the user (if any)

  Repositories:
    - load data to/from backend services (CRUD api)
    - implement a key-value hashmap for easy referencing of members
      (caching)
    - implement a state variable for the controllers to listen to

    Dive Centers
    Staff
    Activity Panels
    Dashboard Sections

  Controllers:
    - hold the structured state for the views to consume
    - expose methods for the views to change state
    - update the repositories when significant changes occur

TODO:
  Account create, edit field:
    Customers - accounts that have unique id's therefore login is not supported (they can't use the app)
    Staff - accounts that use the email address as id, it's global throughout all the dive centers

    - basic info
    - Documents
    - Certifications
    - History section in the profile page

  Activity Panel:

    -- Manage panels


  Activities:



  Dashboard:


  use bloc for state management:
    - refactor Login page, Dive Center pages

  Hive:
    - page to manage raw data  (for mock content)
    - models should implement save(), get() method to load and save to the relevant box




Dive center:
  Export data: Settings, activities, activity boards, users
  Delete: Settings, activities, activity boards

Users:
  Delete: what should happen with the dive bases and activities?


DiveCenter - Account relationship:
  Get all users for a given dive center: "http://192.168.43.145:5984/divemanager/_design/activity_center/_view/staff?key={$dive_center}"
  Get all divecenters for a given user


Add existing users to dive center:
  Online:
    1) Administrator adds the user to the dive center and sets up a password to activate it
    2) The user inputs the password and activates his account
    3) The administrator reviews the accounts, and activates it
  Offline:
    Show all the users from the database

Compact database:
  Delete stale values:
    Accounts: diveCenterRoles - delete dive centers and or dive center roles that don't exist anymore


Activities:
  archived activities: no modifications allowed, requires management level permissions to set/unset


BUGS:
  Dive Center:
    Issue1: When selecting a new logo the last modified field resets to its previous state.
      Solutions: switch image picker library, or force the form to save its state)

Dive groups validation rules:
  - "Certified divers" = Discover Local Diving
  Ratios: define rule for a course or course module
  Age: define rules for a course or course module
  Conflicts: define two courses that conflict with each other (for example AOW Deep vs OW, AOW NAV vs DLD, DSD vs DLD)




Issues:
  - Authetication:
    * Google Sign In
    * App Sign In
    * Server authentication
          - with Oauth2 accessToken retrieve user name (or user ID)
          - and create/return user document from Couchbase
          - return the list of the dive centers the user has activities or is staff of
              a) all the dive centers the user is owner of = [id_of_center, docs::id_of_center]
              b) all divecenters the user is staff of = [id_of_center, docs::id_of_center]
              c) divecenters the user has activities for, but not staff (ie Customer) = [id_of_center]

  - Replication:
    - channels
       - each divecenter will have two channels
            1) the channel to replicate the document [id_of_center]
            2) a channel for all related documents [docs::id_of_center]
       - users will have one channel [id_of_user] - their activities belong to this

  - Subscriptions:
   * In-App subscription
      Subscription plans:
        1) Basic - 1 "remote" divecenter
        2) Advanced - 3 "remote" divecenter
        3) Pro - 5 "remote" divecenters
        4) Enterprise - Unlimited "remote" divecenters

      - plans control how many dive centers can be created
      - how many can be made

 Use case 1:
  - User subscribes to Advanced plan, creates 2 remote dive centers.
  - User downgrades to basic
        Result: Ask which dive center backup should be cancelled.
        The documents for that dive center will not be replicated anymore by any of the deviced.
        (Making changes in different devices will cause the data to diverge)

Use case 2:
  - User subscribes to any plan, creates the amount of remote dive centers he wants
  - User cancels the plan
        Result: all dive centers stop being "remote". The user can use them without further replication. Data is kept on the server
